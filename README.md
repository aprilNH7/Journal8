# Architecture
1. Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
2. Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

A: In my full stack project, I employed numerous types of frontend development techniques, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA) architecture. Express HTML allowed me to render dynamic HTML content using template engines, making it easier to manage and serve static files. JavaScript was important for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages. The SPA architecture provided a seamless user experience by dynamically updating the content without requiring a full page reload, which improved performance and responsiveness. The SPA approach also facilitated better state management and smoother transitions between different parts of the application.

For the backend, I chose a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility in handling unstructured data, scalability, and ease of integration with JavaScript-based frameworks. MongoDB's schema-less nature allowed for rapid development and iteration, making it an ideal choice for handling the dynamic and evolving data requirements of my project.

# Functionality
1. How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
2. Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

A: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Unlike JavaScript, which is a full-fledged programming language, JSON is purely a data format. JSON serves as a bridge between the frontend and backend development by providing a common format for data exchange. It allows the frontend to send structured data to the backend and receive responses in a standardized format, facilitating smooth communication between the two layers.

Throughout the full stack development process, I refactored code multiple times to increase functionality and efficiency. For instance, I modularized the code by creating reusable UI components, which reduced redundancy and improved maintainability. These components allowed me to easily update and manage the user interface without affecting the overall application structure. Reusable components also contributed to a consistent user experience and made the application more scalable.

# Testing
1. Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

A: Making sure the reliability and security of a full stack application requires extensive API testing. Numerous methods such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing were employed to verify the functionality of API endpoints. Unit testing focused on individual functions and components, while integration testing ensured that different parts of the application worked together as expected. End-to-end testing simulated real-world scenarios to validate the application's behavior from the user's perspective.

Testing with added layers of security presented challenges, as it involved verifying authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms. It was important to test how the application handled secure data transmission and user access control. Methods such as token-based authentication and encrypted communication were applied and tested to make sure that the application adhered to security best practices.

# Reflection
1. How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

A: This course has been great in helping me achieve my professional goals by equipping me with essential and important skills in full stack development. I have learned to design and apply complex web applications, manage databases, and make sure secure data exchange between frontend and backend systems occured. The hands-on experience with numerous technologies and frameworks has increased my problem-solving abilities and made me a more marketable candidate in the tech industry. By mastering tools and techniques such as SPA architecture, NoSQL databases, and extensive API testing, I am now better prepared to tackle real-world challenges in my career.
